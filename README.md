Thoughts:
This was my first experience with programming and I was very excited but also a little bit anxious to try it. However, after looking through P5.js' references and trying them out, it seemed more logical than I had expected. 

Describe your first independent coding process (in relation to thinking, reading, copying, modifying, writing, uploading, sharing, commenting code)
How your coding process is differ or similar to reading and writing text? (You may also reflect upon Annette Vee's text on coding literacy)
What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?
