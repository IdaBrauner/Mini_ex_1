Thoughts:
This was my first experience with programming and I was very excited but also a little bit anxious to try it. However, after looking through P5.js' references and trying them out, it seemed more logical than I had expected. 
I ended up with some different 3D shapes rotating in different directions and in differen colors.
At first I tried creating some shapes, mostly the ellipse, and I tried experimenting with the size and placement of it. The fact that you can see the result of your inputs immediately after you've saved your inputs in Atom, makes it easier to figure out what the different inputs does and if you have made a mistake. However, I sometimes experienced that either the page would turn white or some of the movements I had written would stop. This was a clear sign that something didn't work the way I intended it to work. I found it difficult to figure out why the inputs didn't work the intended way or why a new input could make everything else disappear. I even experienced it when i copied some of the examples without making any changes. Sometimes I dicovered the mistake and made the necessary changes for it to work and other times I gave up and looked for other opportunities. But the exploring of the mistakes and the inputs, also made me learn something. For example I discovered, that by adding a 4th value in a RGB color, the 4th number decides the opacity of the color and it ranges from 0.0(transparent) to 1.0(opaque). When there is a 4th value, RGB turns into RGBA. 
I also had some issues when I wanted to insert some text. I had already made some 3D shapes, and I wanted to put text in as well and especially to make the text 3D and to rotate as well. Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to make the text 3D and i discovered, to my disappointment, that you can't have 2D and 3D in the same canvas at the same time. 
As I explored more of the references and played around with it, I definitely learned it faster than I had expected. To me coding seems quite logical but at the same time you definitely have to practice it a lot to succeed. I hope, that as I gain more knowledge and practice, I will be able to code and create more freely and advanced. 

To me, coding seems similar to text, in the way that even though it is just som numbers and letters you type, they will create a meaning when put together. If you're writing, let's say a paper, and you've made many spelling mistakes and errors in you sentences, it will be hard to understand or maybe even impossible. The same with coding. If you haven't typed the input correct, it will either create something unexpected or nothing at all. However, in writing text, people can understand the same thing in different ways, whereas in coding, it is either written right or wrong. 

What might be the potential and possibility of coding practice?
